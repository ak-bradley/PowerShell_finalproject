# PowerShell_finalproject
Windows &amp; PowerShell Lab Automation and Virtualization Project

This coursework is a comprehensive Windows and PowerShell final assignment designed to simulate the responsibilities of a junior IT administrator in a small enterprise
environment. The task focuses on building a structured IT lab, automating administrative tasks, and documenting technical processes using PowerShell and Windows tools.

The assignment begins with filesystem organization, where a standardized directory structure is created under C:\ITLab. A PowerShell script automates folder creation,
applies appropriate permissions, generates explanatory welcome files, and logs the setup process. This part demonstrates an understanding of file management, access
control, and basic automation.

The second part focuses on system and user information collection. A PowerShell script gathers key system data such as user identity, computer name, operating system
version, disk space, and running services. Conditional logic and loops are used to detect stopped critical services and display warnings, reinforcing core scripting 
concepts and administrative monitoring practices. The collected information is documented in a structured report.

The third section introduces virtualization using Hyper-V. A virtual machine is created and configured via PowerShell with defined specifications, and the process is
logged. An operating system is installed on the VM, followed by validation tasks such as status checks, memory usage retrieval, and command execution inside the VM.
This part demonstrates practical knowledge of virtualization, testing environments, and system documentation.

The fourth part focuses on file processing and automation. A script generates sample user files, processes them using loops, and produces a summary report while
displaying processed file counts, reinforcing automation and data handling skills.

The coursework concludes with a written report documenting the process, explaining script functionality, justifying technical choices, and reflecting on learning
outcomes. Overall, the assignment demonstrates foundational Windows administration skills, PowerShell scripting proficiency, and an understanding of automation
in real-world IT environments.
